		<h3>Lyrics</h3>
			<!-- Verse 1 -->
			<p>
				Vanquished every hint of <span>doubt</span><br>
				'Cause here lousy vibes are out of <span>bounds</span><br>
				Call us <span>contumelious</span><br>
				Couldn't care less; nobody wanted to <span>impress</span><br>
				
				Working on a thorough <span>purge</span><br>
				Move away or be knocked off your <span>perch</span><br>
				We strive for the greater <span>good</span><br>
				Firm ground, we stood even when <span>misunderstood</span><br>
				
				Took for granted the easier way of <span>life</span><br>
				The moment to now <span>decide</span><br>
				Is it worth causing all the endless <span>strife?</span><br>
				Hear your voice burning <span>inside</span><br>
				
				Maybe there will be <span>mercy</span><br>
				Soon enough, you'll <span>see</span><br>
				On the contrary <span>belief</span><br>
				It won't end in grief if you confront <span>reality</span><br>
				Pick your <span>poison</span><br>
			</p>
			
			<!-- Chorus -->
			<p>
				Truth or <span>dare</span><br>
				Let's be <span>fair</span><br>
				Take the <span>pair</span><br>
				For us to be <span>square</span><br>
				We were <span>born</span><br>
				First <span>forlorn</span><br>
				Then <span>reborn</span><br>
				To live to <span>transform</span><br>
				Set things <span>straight</span><br>
				Not too <span>late</span><br>
				Liberate the world from <span>stalemate</span><br>
				It's our <span>life</span><br>
				We shall <span>drive</span><br>
				Don't <span>deprive</span><br>
				What nature <span>designed</span><br>

			<!-- Verse 2 -->
			<p>
				It's starting to get <span>intense</span><br>
				Who's enjoying this show of <span>suspense?</span><br>
				I'd say we are on a <span>roll</span><br>
				No fear at <span>all</span><br>
				Ready for what the future <span>holds</span><br>
				
				Abundance of feats <span>unheard</span><br>
				Either way, it's hard to put in <span>words</span><br>
				When freedom is <span>compromised</span><br>
				Heroes disguised stood up before the <span>demise</span><br>
				Never thought of doing something <span>notable</span><br>
				But anyone can <span>arise</span><br>
				As long as they're people of <span>principle</span><br>
				With the power to <span>realize</span><br>
				
				One take at this game of <span>life</span><br>
				Live a little <span>sly</span><br>
				Chance is not gonna come <span>by</span><br>
				On its own <span>tonight</span><br>
				Find your own way to light the <span>light</span><br>
				What's your <span>purpose?</span><br>
			</p>
			
			<!-- Bridge -->
			<p>
				Harmony sounds so <span>sweet</span><br>
				If you're free from <span>authority</span><br>
				Look around; they're <span>earthbound</span><br>
				'Cause you frown upon those who gain <span>ground</span><br>
				
				Listen up; Life is <span>tough</span><br>
				Suck it up; we'll get through; no <span>bluff</span><br>
				In shorthand, <span>understand</span><br>
				There's reason we're called the wise <span>man</span><br>
				
				Shouldn't <span>speculate</span><br>
				Everybody is the <span>same</span><br>
				Better <span>remember</span><br>
				Definition will <span>differ</span><br>
				Vision may <span>expand</span><br>
				Doesn't ever go to <span>plan</span><br>
				Sit back, watch it <span>out</span><br>
			</p>

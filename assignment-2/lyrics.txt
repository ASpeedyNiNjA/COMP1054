Vanquished every hint of doubt
'Cause here lousy vibes are out of bounds
Call us contumelious
Couldn't care less; nobody wanted to impress

Working on a thorough purge
Move away or be knocked off your perch
We strive for the greater good
Firm ground, we stood even when misunderstood

Took for granted the easier way of life
The moment to now decide
Is it worth causing all the endless strife?
Hear your voice burning inside

Maybe there will be mercy
Soon enough, you'll see
On the contrary belief
It won't end in grief if you confront reality
Pick your poison

[Chorus]
Truth or dare
Let's be fair
Take the pair
For us to be square
We were born
First forlorn
Then reborn
To live to transform
Set things straight
Not too late
Liberate the world from stalemate
It's our life
We shall drive
Don't deprive
What nature designed

[Verse 2]
It's starting to get intense
Who's enjoying this show of suspense?
I'd say we are on a roll
No fear at all
Ready for what the future holds

Abundance of feats unheard
Either way, it's hard to put in words
When freedom is compromised
Heroes disguised stood up before the demise
Never thought of doing something notable
But anyone can arise
As long as they're people of principle
With the power to realize

One take at this game of life
Live a little sly
Chance is not gonna come by
On its own tonight
Find your own way to light the light
What's your purpose?

[Chorus 2]???
Harmony sounds so sweet
If you're free from authority
Look around; they're earthbound
'Cause you frown upon those who gain ground

Listen up; Life is tough
Suck it up; we'll get through; no bluff
In shorthand, understand
There's reason we're called the wise man

Shouldn't speculate
Everybody is the same
Better remember
Definition will differ
Vision may expand
Doesn't ever go to plan
Sit back, watch it out

[music note]

[Chorus 1]
Truth or dare
Let's be fair
Take the pair
For us to be square

We were born
First forlorn
Then reborn
To live to transform
Set things straight
Not too late
Liberate the world from stalemate

It's our life
We shall drive
Don't deprive
What nature designed
